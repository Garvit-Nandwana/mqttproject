# Random Data Publisher

## This project serves as a simple application that publishes random data from one application
## to another using the Mosquitto test server/broker.The data is generated using the random library in Python.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a basic implementation of a data publisher using the 
MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol. MQTT is a lightweight and efficient messaging protocol that 
is widely used for communication between IoT (Internet of Things) devices.
